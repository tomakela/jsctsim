=======

HTML5/JavaScript based contrast, noise and resolution demonstration application for computed tomography

www.helsinki.fi/~tdmakela/app.html

To run jsctsim offline with Chrome, you need to allow access to local files:

Create Chrome-shortcut and set the following arguments
  "C:\PathToChrome\Chrome.exe" --allow-file-access-from-files "C:\PathToJsctsim\app.html"
  
Note 1. Quotation marks are needed if your paths include spaces.
Note 2. For this to work you need to close all your Chrome instances before starting the one with --allow-file-access-from-files
